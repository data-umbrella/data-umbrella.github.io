<p>Time series are everywhere around us. Understanding them requires taking into account the sequence of values seen in previous steps and even long-term temporal correlations. Bruno Goncalves explains a broad range of traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques to model and analyze time series datasets with an emphasis on practical applications.
Bruno will be presenting a 2-day workshop at an upcoming event:
Oâ€™Reilly Strata Data and AI Conference (New York, NY) (Sep 2020)</p>
