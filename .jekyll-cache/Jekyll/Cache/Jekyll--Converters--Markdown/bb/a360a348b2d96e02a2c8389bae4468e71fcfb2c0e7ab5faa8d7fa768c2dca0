<p>Continuing on my Open Source Adventure, yesterday I spent 4 hours working with 40 other Open Source Aspirants to contribute to the popular machine learning library, Scikit-Learn as part of the Data Umbrella + NYC PyLadies Scikit-Learn Open Source Sprint. It was a phenomenal experience and I would like to cover some of the highlights and encourage you to seek similar opportunities in the future.</p>
