<h2 id="sprint-background">Sprint Background</h2>
<p>This â€œsprintâ€ is a hands-on hackathon where participants learn to contribute to scikit-learn, a widely-used Python open source, machine learning library.</p>

<p>This sprint was organized by <a href="https://www.dataumbrella.org">Data Umbrella</a> to increase the participation of underrepresented persons in data science, with a focus on the geographic region of Latin America (LATAM).</p>

<p>This report focuses on the summary, impact and lessons learned of the Data Umbrella LATAM scikit-learn sprint.</p>

<h2 id="resources-for-contributing-to-scikit-learn">Resources for Contributing to scikit-learn</h2>
<p>Because this was a virtual event and there is a limited capacity for being online for a full 8-hour day, a checklist was provided so folks could do preparation work at their own pace prior to the sprint.  <a href="https://latam2021.dataumbrella.org/about/prep-work">Resources for Prep Work</a> are available on the sprint website.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QknhXDJ4qtP8Co2SfqaPGaZ8J5grsMq08onxTXVvAFU/edit?usp=sharing">Checklist</a> with highlighted notes to indicate updates from videos was also included.</p>

<p>This visualization shows which resources were used for sprint preparation.  Note that n=21, which represents those participants who completed the feedback survey.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<h3 id="non-measurable-impact">Non-measurable Impact</h3>
<p>Aside from the number of PRs that were merged, there is non-quantifiable impact of the open source sprint. Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>learning to set up virtual environment</li>
  <li>using Git (fork, clone, branch, fetching anotherâ€™s PR)</li>
  <li>introduction to tests such as:  flake8 (linting, formatting), pytest, â€œcontinuous integrationâ€</li>
  <li>navigating through the codebase structure of scikit-learn</li>
  <li>digging into functions, learning about errors</li>
  <li>learning about unit tests</li>
  <li>interacting with contributors on GitHub</li>
  <li>learning, in general</li>
  <li>networking</li>
  <li>building confidence (making a dent in â€œimposter syndromeâ€)</li>
  <li>having fun</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="event-outreach">Event Outreach</h2>
<p>Sprint outreach can be considered an impact.  Even if folks do not attend or apply, the sprint outreach brings more visibility and interest to the project.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/DataUmbrella/status/1394661734275821573">LATAM sprint tweet</a>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<h3 id="outreach">Outreach</h3>
<p>Outreach was resource intensive. The communities exist, and it takes intensive networking and meetings to find communities, the community leaders and the platforms to reach potential sprint participants.</p>

<p>For those who attended the sprint, this is how they learned of the event. The main avenues were Twitter, LinkedIn and their network (â€œword of mouthâ€).</p>

<p float="left">
  <img src="../images/2021-latam/found-sprint.png" width="99%" height="99%" style="border:0px;margin:0px" />
</p>

<h3 id="videos">Videos</h3>
<p>The videos that were created can be quickly outdated compared to static print. Videos are more accessible, but also take more effort to create.</p>

<p>Some of the video content created is outdated.  A few of the following items need to be updated:</p>
<ul>
  <li>branch on GitHub repo changed from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> in January 2021</li>
  <li>instructions for setting up virtual environment has been updated in the past year</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="language-translations">Language Translations</h3>
<p>Responses to the sprint outreach were initially low.  The website and social media announcements were translated into Spanish and Portuguese.  Also, a number of other resources were translated, including video transcripts and feedback surveys.</p>

<p>We had translators at all 3 events: pre-sprint, sprint, post-sprint.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s challenging and resource intensive to provide translations in 3 different languages.</p>

<h2 id="adjustments-for-next-sprint">Adjustments for Next Sprint</h2>

<h3 id="collecting-names">Collecting Names</h3>
<p>Important to have an optional field for â€œMiddle Nameâ€ in addition to â€œFirst Nameâ€ and â€œLast Nameâ€ in the application form for Latin America region.</p>

<h3 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>Explore live pair programming tools.</p>

<h3 id="dataumbrella-hashtag">#DataUmbrella Hashtag</h3>
<p>Reminder to sprint participants to include this hashtag #DataUmbrella on their pull requests so we can track them.</p>

<h3 id="videos-1">Videos</h3>
<p>Videos are outdated. Consider if it is helpful to include them in the pre-work.</p>

<h2 id="sprint-feedback">Sprint Feedback</h2>

<p>FeedbackÂ has been shared a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1409666048144596996">Moment</a></li>
  <li>Blogs (* none yet* )</li>
  <li>Sprint survey</li>
  <li>Social media (LinkedIn)</li>
  <li>Casually, in conversation during the sprint, pre-sprint and post-sprint events</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-umbrella-feedback-survey">Data Umbrella Feedback Survey</h2>
<p>Data Umbrella received 21 responses to our internal sprint survey. (21/40 = 52.5% response rate).</p>

<p>Respondents rated their overall sprint experience highly favorably and had a positive experience working with their pair programming partner.</p>

<h3 id="language">Language</h3>
<p>The survey was translated from English to both Spanish and Portuguese.  This is the breakdown in responses received, by language:</p>
<ul>
  <li>English: 16</li>
  <li>Spanish: 4</li>
  <li>Portuguese: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>In response to the question â€œ<em>What are your favorite parts about the sprint?</em>â€</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pull request (PR)</li>
  <li>The pre sprint was very helpful</li>
  <li>Everything! I was nervous but I could enjoy and learn all the event, was really good to meet everyone in Zoom and working with a partner.</li>
  <li>All, was ok!</li>
  <li>Working on the PR!</li>
  <li>I could work on two issues and meet some interesting people.</li>
  <li>Meeting new people and working in an open source project.</li>
  <li>The mentors that were ready to answer our questions, made me feel really secure about contributing</li>
  <li>Support from organizers and contributors. Engangement of the newbies. Overall networking.</li>
  <li>I liked the whole process,  I can see the effort in the organization.</li>
  <li>Being able to be in touch with an open source project and realizing how I can contribute to it, even with limited coding skills.</li>
  <li>Discord time</li>
  <li>Nothing to comment about it, all was fine.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="some-general-feedback-in-the-survey">Some general feedback in the survey:</h4>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I think the difficulty of contributing to open source is two-fold: 
(1) the tools: are not straightforward - `git`, `pytest`, etc. 
(2) the knowledge: is very specific.
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe the preparation for the sprint could split the preparation into this steps. With github actions, learning the tools can be even easier.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I loved that. It has been my first experience in contributing with open source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall the sprint was a good experience, the one slight â€œissueâ€ I had was with the prework. I stressed a bit trying to get it all done before the deadline, but that didnâ€™t end up being important. It definitely was useful, though, I just happened to have a very busy week at work while preparing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a bit shy to talk at the end of the event. I am really thankful to all the organizers. I am a great fan of sklearn so being able to participate was fantastic. Also, a great opportunity to learn in general and to learn how to contribute. Now I will continue contributing, but this was not something I thought I could do before, the Sprint and the mentors really help me to change my mind. The videos and documentation we had to read before the sprint were very useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a really nice experience. I felt supported by the mentors and my partner, the code was appropriate. Itâ€™s a great place to begin on contribute on open source.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="suggestions-for-improvement">Suggestions for Improvement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A more step-by-step explanation for the â€œbeginner PRâ€ would have speed up things.</li>
  <li>If I had installed all required packages previously. I just installed the development and not the documentation ones.</li>
  <li>Maybe having two shorter separate sessions</li>
  <li>Issue selection and categorization.</li>
  <li>Probably the way to inform the time of the event, there were some misunderstandings with the time zones</li>
  <li>I didnâ€™t have this problem, but I saw many people were waiting on an issue to be merged (that made them loose the momentum) and then they had a few merge conflicts. I think the attendees with the problem should have immeditaly banded together as a team with a few mentors that could guide them and explain them the process, because some confessed to me that they were scared of the merge conflicts and that more advanced git stuff.</li>
  <li>Instructions to test before submitting. For instance: to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">black</code>, besides <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flake8</code>.</li>
  <li>Having the videos updated</li>
  <li>It would be nice to have an article about free pair programming tools.</li>
</ul>
