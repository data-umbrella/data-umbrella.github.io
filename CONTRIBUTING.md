# Contributing to the Data Umbrella Blog
This repository houses the code for Data Umbrella's **Jekyll** blog hosted at [blog.dataumbrella.org](https://blog.dataumbrella.org). The blog was scaffolded using the [Menca theme](theme-author.md) by [Artem Sheludko](https://jekyllthemes.io/developers/artem-sheludko).

- **Ruby**: is a programming language used to build software applications
- **Jekyll**: is a static site generator written in Ruby
- Ruby & Jekyll: Jekyll is built with Ruby, so to use Jekyll, you need to have Ruby installed on your system. When you run Jekyll commands (like `jekyll serve`), you're actually running Ruby scripts under the hood.

## Contributing & Operational Guidelines


### Blog Posts
- The blog posts are in markdown file (`.md`) and are located at: [data-umbrella.github.io/_posts](https://github.com/data-umbrella/data-umbrella.github.io/tree/main/_posts)
- You can copy and rename an existing markdown post and edit it.

### Images
- Images can be placed in this folder: [data-umbrella.github.io/images](https://github.com/data-umbrella/data-umbrella.github.io/tree/main/images)
- We suggest putting images related to one blog in its own folder to keep the files organized.
