## Introduction

Clair Sullivan, a Developer Advocate for Neo4j, presented to the Data Umbrella community a tutorial on arrays, linked lists and graphs.

It is easy and convenient to treat all data as an array. They are the basis of much of Python and a simple data structure to deal with. But there are times that arrays fail us, such as on element insertion and the pre-allocation of memory. There is power and efficiency in linking data through data structures such as linked lists. We will see how using linked lists can reduce Big O complexity and solve a variety of problems. Then we will explore how graph data structures take this a step further and open up a world of new options and opportunities for efficient computation.

## Outline of Tutorial

Below is a summary of topics that were covered:  
- PART 1: Arrays
- PART 2: Linked Lists
- PART 3: LeetCode
