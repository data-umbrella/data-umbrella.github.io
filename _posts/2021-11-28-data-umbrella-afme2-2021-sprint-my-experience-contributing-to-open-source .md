I always felt that if I contributed in one way or another I will not only give back but also have a better understanding behind the code and what makes up the libraries or software I use. Therefore, when Miriam Haji who is part of Data Umbrella told me about the sprint I saw a great opportunity to finally contribute to Open Source.
