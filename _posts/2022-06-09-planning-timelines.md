## Planning Data Science Events

Recently, I solidified a spreadsheet with key milestone dates for planning steps leading up the main event, including pre- and post-event tasks.  This resource is built on the experience of organizing dozens of workshops over the years in data science. 

## Instructions

- **F1: Event Date:** this is the anchor field which lists the day of the main event
- **Task**: add a list of key tasks, or more detailed steps for work leading up to the event
- **Note**: add a reminder note or a more detailed task description in this column
- **Owner(s)**: add person(s) who are responsible for executing this task
- **Start Date**: (optional) add a `Start Date` for tasks that span a range of days
- **Day**: this field is in `days`, and indicates how far before the main event this task needs to be computed.  For our events, we typically begin planning 10 weeks prior to the main event
- **Deadine**: this field is computed from `Event Date` and `Day`

Feel free to open the Google Sheets (which is "read-only"), make a copy and adjust it for your event.  

We encourage you to adjust the spreadsheet according to your event needs.
