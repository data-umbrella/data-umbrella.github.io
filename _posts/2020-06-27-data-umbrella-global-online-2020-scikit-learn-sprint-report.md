This sprint was organized by [Reshama Shaikh](https://reshamas.github.io) of [Data Umbrella](https://www.dataumbrella.org) and [NYC PyLadies](http://nyc.pyladies.com/) to increase the participation of underrepresented persons in data science.  All organization of this sprint was by volunteer time.  

The sprint was originally scheduled to be an in-person event in New York City.  It would have been the fourth year in a row that I (Reshama Shaikh) would have organized a sprint in NYC.  Due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was pivoted to become a virtual event.  

This report focuses on the summary, impact and lessons learned of the **first online** scikit-learn sprint.
