I have had the privilege of using Scikit-learn for my data science projects and it was one of the first tools that I learned in data science. It is very powerful because it allows the user to conduct predictive analytics using various mathematical models ranging from older models such as Linear Regression to newer ones such as Neural Networks.
It was therefore a great honor to participate in the 2020 Scikit-learn online sprint organized by [Reshama Shaikh](https://twitter.com/reshamas) of Data Umbrella, and learn how to contribute to open-source projects. It was such a wonderful experience that I was inspired to write this article, hoping that you also get inspired to contribute to open-source.
