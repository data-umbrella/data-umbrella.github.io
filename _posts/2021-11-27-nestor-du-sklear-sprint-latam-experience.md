I participated in my first (LATAM) [scikit-learn open source sprint](https://latam2021.dataumbrella.org) in June 2021, organized by Data Umbrella.
I learned of the event through word-of-mouth, via a friend of mine. I had already a general interest in the open source philosophy and movement. Currently, I am not an active collaborator for any initiative but I always try to help when is possible. 
This article is focused not on my open source journey; it is focused on my experience in the Data Umbrella's scikit-learn sprint, the first one that was focused on the Latin America region.
