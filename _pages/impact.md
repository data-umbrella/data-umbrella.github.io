## Lauren Burke-McCarthy: Gives her first solo presentation
In March 2022, as part of a special series of Data Umbrella events to celebrate [Women’s Month](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKcU7Ik-ir9dIg5voCwc6FSFlkpAXYFH), Lauren Burke presented on how to [Create a Free Data Blog with Jekyll & GitHub Pages](https://youtu.be/7SBXl94xNl8) which was her first solo talk.

She shares her experience and some tips for fist time speakers in the blog [Interview with Lauren Burke: Giving Her First Solo Presentation](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/lburke)

>Even if you feel like you don’t have as much experience as others or haven’t been in a field long enough, your perspective is important and sharing your knowledge can benefit others. Always remember that right now, someone is at the stage you were 1, 5, or 10 years ago. What you share could help them!

While sharing the benefits of public speaking, Lauren said: 
>Giving this presentation definitely improved my confidence in my ability to speak publicly in front of larger audiences. It was also nice to have positive feedback on the talk content itself! As a data scientist, communication skills are so important and it was great to hear from attendees what they found interesting and beneficial. I’ve been thinking about applying to speak at larger events and conferences - taking what I’ve learned from the experience and applying it to other topics.

## Joseph Lucas: 2020 Scikit-Learn Open Source Sprint
Joseph Lucas participated in the [2020 scikit-learn Open Source Sprint](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/data-umbrella-global-online-2020-scikit-learn-sprint-report) and shared his experience in the blog "[My Open Source Adventure](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/joe-lucas-online-2020-my-open-source-adventure)". Since then, he has brought his security expertise to open source projects. He is a Security Council Member for [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/security) and is the chair of the [NumFOCUS Security Committee](https://github.com/numfocus/Security-Best-Practices).

He shares his open source experiences in this [Joe Lucas Interview with Data Umbrella](https://blog.dataumbrella.org/joelucas-opensource-experience)

>The sprint gave me the experience and confidence to continue engaging with open source projects. I learned more about maintainers’ perspectives and challenges and now understand that there is a wide spectrum of valuable contributions.

## Daniel Saunders: 2023 Google Summer of Code Intern with PyMC
Daniel Saunders participated in the July 2022 PyMC Open Source Working Sessions, and in June 2023, joined the PyMC project as a Google Summer of Code intern.

Daniel shares in the [PyMC 2023 Interns blog](https://www.pymc.io/blog/blog_gsoc_2023.html)
>I participated in a PyMC sprint in July 2022, organized with Data Umbrella. I remember Reshama Shaikh, Ravin Kumar, Rowan Schaefer, and Oriol Abril Pla being really nice and super helpful. They taught me how git works and how to tidy up doc strings.
Juan Martín Loyola joined the Data Umbrella Latin America sprint in June 2021, and he was an invited contributor to the Data Umbrella Africa and Middle East sprint in October 2021.  In this interview, learn more about Juan Martín's journey in open source. From a computer user to first contributing to PyMC, then Google Summer of Code, Data Umbrella's Latin America #ScikitLearnSprint, to Triage Team member with scikit-learn.

## Gloria Macia: Shared open source experience at PyData London

>I am happy to share that the JP Morgan Python award at PyData London 2022 went to Gloria Macia, who gave a highly engaging explanation of the Data Umbrella project. The project's mission is to provide a welcoming and educational space for under-represented persons in the fields of machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. A great project I will look into in more detail. Thank you Gloria!"
